'''
    1. Write an implementation of FizzBuzz iteratively. 
    
    FizzBuzz takes in an integer n, and for every number from 1 - n,
    prints "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if it is divisible
    by 5, and "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by 15.
'''

def FizzBuzz(n):
    #Your code here
    pass


'''
    2. Write both an iterative and list comprehension solution to the following:
    
    Given a list of integers (myList), print the number * 10 if the number is NOT 
    a multiple of ten.

'''
myList = [10, 11, 15, 17, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 35, 36, 40, 45, 50]

def IterativeFunc():
    #Your code here
    pass

def ListComprehensionFunc():
    #Your code here
    pass

'''
    3. Write a function that prints every three letter permutation of the alphabet
    using a data structure comprehension. Be focused on doing it pythonically.

def AlphabetPermuation():
    #Your code here
    pass
